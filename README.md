# Pokédex

The application will display a list of data items,  load items from an external API, allowing the user to search for items and to get a detailed view of each individual item on the list.

## Built with

* JavaScript
* jQuery
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap

## Features and Requirements

Users should be able to view a list of data and see more details for a given data item on demand.

## Technical Requirements

* The app must load data from an external API; for instance, the Pokémon API.
* The app must display a list of items loaded from that API after the page is loaded.
* The app must enable the viewing of more details for a given list item (like a Pokémon) on
demand, such as when clicking on a list item.
* The app must have CSS styling.
* The JavaScript code must be formatted according to ESLint rules.
* The JavaScript code may be formatted via Prettier.
* The JavaScript code may be manually formatted.
* The app must use at least one additional complex UI pattern, such as a modal, for details or
touch interactions.
* The app may allow searching for items (e.g., searching for Pokémon).
* The app must not throw any errors when being used.
* The app should be deployed to a publicly accessible platform like GitHub Pages (you can
review how to do this in Intro to Frontend Development's Exercise 10: Code Quality, Testing, &
Web Hosting).
* The app must work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11.

### Nice to have:
* The app should show loading indicators while loading data.
* The app should handle errors (such as trying to load data while offline) and show user-friendly
error messages.
